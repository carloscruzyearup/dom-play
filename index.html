						Cage is wearing an EXOJACKET: powered, tight-fitting body<br>
						armor, bristling with weaponry. TWO DOZEN OTHER young,<br>
						terrified SOLDIERS hang with him, also jacketed, dangling<br>
						over the OPEN BAY DOORS, over OCEAN.<br><br>

						Cage taps a button. His faceplate opens, NOISE floods in at a<br>

					FROM UP FRONT, BATTLE-SCARRED SGT. FARELL shoots them a look.<br>
